 The Canada-India Institutional Co-operation Project Model which was exemplary success in the Polytechnics was extended to SJP, during the November 1998.  Under this model the initiatives namely Continuing Education Cell has been introduced in order to achieve development of the Institution.  Now the Continuing Ecucation Cell under CIICP had been renamed as  CCTEK during the year 2002-2003.<br><br>
    The major thrust is on the Continuing Education Cell which encompasses the needs of the Industry, Business and Community by organizing short/full term training programmes.  With new economic avenues opening up, especially with the introduction of liberalization, privatization and globalization policies by the Govt., the need of the personnel working in the above areas demand upgradation of their skills to match the introduction of new technologies.<br><br> These are the areas where the Continuing Education Cell plays a great role in organizing programmes to meet the demand.  Running of programmes would generate revenue which is utilized for the overall development of the institution as and when decided by the Advisory Committee of the institute.<br><br>
    In addiditon, the Continuing Education Cell identifies the needs of the students for easy employability by giving suitable inputs through guest lectures, Indistrial visits and updation of the syllabus periodically to include technological changes with active participation from Industry / Business and Professionals.<br><br>
      The CCTEK is conducting the training programmes for students and staff in Office Automation, CNC Programme, Programming in C, Fabrication and servicing of Led Acid batteries and UPS, Motor rewinding.  The Cell has also been instrumental in conducting “learning skills” training programmes for all final year students of our Polytechnic, thus improving their communication skills and presentation skills as also instilling in them the rudiments of career guidance by means of group discussions & Mock interviews.  This has helped the students to get good placements in various Industries also.<br><br>
      A number of courses are conducted for various officers of the Secretrariat, Agricultural deparment, various other colleges and a vast number public with a nominal cost.  Training is also being given to 300 to 400 SC & ST students in computers.  CCTEK has earned quite a substantial amount as IRG out of which expenses for various developemental activities are met.
